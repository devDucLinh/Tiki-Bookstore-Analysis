The Tiki Bookstore Analysis project is aimed at analyzing data from bookstores on the Tiki e-commerce platform. The goal is to gain insights into the book market, customer preferences, and sales trends. The project involves crawling data from Tiki, performing data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis, and visualizing the findings.

## Data Crawling

The data for this project was crawled from the Tiki e-commerce platform. The code and notebooks related to the data crawling process can be found in the `data_scraper` directory.

## Data Preprocessing and EDA

The data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were performed in the `data_processing` directory. The notebook `data_cleaning_and_eda.ipynb` contains the code for cleaning and analyzing the data.

## Data Visualization

The cleaned data was visualized using Tableau. The visualizations can be found in the `data_visualization` directory. The files `nha-sach-tiki-cleaned+.hyper` and `Tiki-BookStore-Analytics.twb` are Tableau files containing the visualizations.
